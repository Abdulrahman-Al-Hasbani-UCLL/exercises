# Exercises combining lists to dictionary - difficulty level: *


Write a function **combine_lists_to_dict** that takes two lists as input and returns a new dictionary where the elements of the first list are the keys, and the elements of the second list are the values. Use *zip()* and a *dictionary comprehension* to create the new dictionary. You can't use the function dict() for this exercise!

```python
keys = ['a', 'b', 'c']
values = [1, 2, 3]
print(combine_lists_to_dict(keys, values)) # output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```
