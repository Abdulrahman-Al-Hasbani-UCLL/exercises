# Basic exercises on zip, map, and filter functions in Python - difficulty level: *

1. Write a Python function **elementwise_sum** that takes two lists as arguments and returns a new list that contains the element-wise sum of the two lists, using the zip function.

```python
Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]
Output: [5, 7, 9]
```

2. Write a Python function **even_numbers** that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns a new list that contains only the even numbers, using the filter function.

```python
Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [2, 4]
```

3. Write a Python function **square_numbers** that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns a new list that contains the squares of the numbers, using the map function.

```python
Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```


4. Write a Python function **map_lists_to_dict** that takes two lists as arguments and returns a new dictionary that maps the elements of the first list to the elements of the second list, using the **zip** and **dict** function.

```python
Example:
Input: ['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3]
Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

5. Write a Python function **length_of_strings** that takes a list of strings and returns a new list of the length of each string, using the map function.

```python
Example:
Input: ['hello', 'world', 'python']
Output: [5, 5, 6]
```

6. Write a Python function **list_of_pairs** that takes two lists as arguments and returns a new list of tuples that contain pairs of elements that have the same index in the two lists, using the zip function.

```python
Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']
Output: [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]
```

7. Write a Python function **positive_numbers** that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns a new list that contains only the positive numbers, using the filter function.

```python
Example:
Input: [-1, -2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [3, 4, 5]
```

8. Write a Python function **cubes_of_numbers** that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns a new list that contains the cubes of the numbers, using the map function.

```python
Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]
```

9. Write a Python function **merge_lists** that takes two lists as arguments and returns a new list that contains the elements of the first list followed by the elements of the second list, using the zip function.

```python
Example:
Input: ['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3]
Output: ['a', 1, 'b', 2, 'c', 3]
```

10. Write a Python function **divisible_by_3** that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns a new list that contains only the numbers that are divisible by 3, using the filter function.

```python
Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Output: [3, 6, 9]
```

11. Write a Python function **repeat_elements** that takes a lists as arguments and returns a new list that contains the elements of the list repeated twice, using zip functions.

```python
Example:
Input: ['a', 'b', 'c']
Output: ['a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c']
```

12. Write a Python function **palindrome_strings** that takes a list of strings as an argument and returns a new list of strings that are palindromes, using the filter function.

```python
Example:
Input: ['hello', 'world', 'python', 'racecar']
Output: ['racecar']
```
