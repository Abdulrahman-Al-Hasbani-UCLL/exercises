# Assignment - difficulty level: *

## Generators

- Write a generator function called **squared_numbers** that generates the squares of all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive), where n is a number passed as an argument to the function.
- write a function called **sum_squared_numbers** that returns the sum of the squares of all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive), where n is a number passed as an argument to the function. You have to use the **squared_numbers** function in the **sum_squared_numbers** function.

## List comprehension

- write a function called **sum_squared_numbers2** that returns the sum of the squares of all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive), where n is a number passed as an argument to the function. ***You have to generate this list of squares using list comprehension first.***

**_NOTE:_**  both the generator and list comprehension will output the same sum of the squared numbers. The difference is that the generator will only generate the next value when it is called and does not store the entire list in memory. While the list comprehension stores the whole list in memory.
