# Fibonacci

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in its definition. This technique is often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems of the same type. Recursion is a powerful concept in computer science and is often used in combination with both linear and non-linear data structures.

# Task

Implement a recursive method `fibonacci(number)` that returns the number-th fibonacci number
calculates (see https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rij_van_Fibonacci). Presumably
you will find a simple and short version that is, however, very inefficient. Can you explain why?
